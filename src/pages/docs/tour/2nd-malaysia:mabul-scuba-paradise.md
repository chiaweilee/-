## Paradise

Paradise but not Sipadan, located just off shore Mabul Island.
Minutes away from the Rig, the dive site is made up of artificial house reef where old dive boats were sunk, man-made structure such as pyramids and crates are now home to abundance of marine life.
The artificial reef is a collaboration work of resorts within and nearby Mabul.

It named "Paradise 2".
