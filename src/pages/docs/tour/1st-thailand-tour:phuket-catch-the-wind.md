## Catch the Wind

It's the last day I stay in Phuket, it heavy rained in the morning,
and the wind below to East which mean planes will not landing at beach side.
Even though, I plan to walking to airport, for photos of plane.

I hide under my umbrella, elude the strong wind.

Rain stopped, wind direction changed! When I reached the end of the road.

I leave the road and step on sand, heading airport along the beach.
And a flood stream stopped me, my camera will die if I fall into it.

Finally, I am at the end of runway.

A A380 take off over my head, too late to get my camera.
I watched my plane radar app and waiting for landing.
I got some plane photos, include a beautiful B747.
And the sky just went to warming and shinning.

I did it by perseverance.
